SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) image colorization using a U-Net architecture with ResNet encoder in PyTorch. This project converts grayscale SAR images to realistic RGB representations, enhancing interpretability for remote sensing applications.

## Features

- **U-Net with ResNet Encoder**: Deep learning architecture for semantic image colorization
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Modern deep learning framework
- **Jupyter Notebook Training**: Interactive training environment
- **SAR Image Processing**: Specialized for radar imagery colorization
- **Enhanced Interpretability**: Converts complex SAR data to visual RGB format

## Applications

- Remote sensing analysis
- Earth observation studies
- SAR image interpretation
- Environmental monitoring
- Research and educational purposes

## Architecture

The system uses a **U-Net with ResNet encoder** architecture:

1. **ResNet Encoder**: Extracts hierarchical features from grayscale SAR images
2. **U-Net Skip Connections**: Preserves spatial information across scales
3. **Decoder**: Reconstructs RGB images with enhanced visual quality
4. **Loss Functions**: Optimized for colorization tasks

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- 4GB+ RAM
- Sufficient storage for datasets

### Dependencies
```
torch
torchvision
numpy
opencv-python
Pillow
matplotlib
jupyter
```

## Installation

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tlmanees2006-dot/SAR-IMAGE-COLOURIZATION.git
cd SAR-IMAGE-COLOURIZATION
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy opencv-python Pillow matplotlib jupyter
```

## Dataset Preparation

Prepare your SAR dataset with the following structure:
```
dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ grayscale/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image1.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image2.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ rgb/
    â”œâ”€â”€ image1.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ image2.png
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Supported Formats
- Input: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`
- Output: `.png`, `.jpg`

## Training

### Using Jupyter Notebook
1. Open the training notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Train.ipynb
```

2. Follow the cells in the notebook to:
   - Load your dataset
   - Configure model parameters
   - Train the U-Net model
   - Monitor training progress
   - Save trained model

### Training Process
The `Train.ipynb` notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model initialization (UNetWithResnetEncoder)
- Training loop with loss computation
- Validation and model checkpointing
- Visualization of results

## Inference

### Single Image Prediction
Use the trained model to colorize SAR images. The inference code is typically included in the notebook or can be implemented as:

```python
import torch
from model import UNetWithResnetEncoder
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Load trained model
model = UNetWithResnetEncoder()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('path/to/model.pth'))
model.eval()

# Load and preprocess image
# (Add your preprocessing code here)

# Inference
with torch.no_grad():
    colorized = model(input_tensor)

# Save result
# (Add your post-processing and saving code here)
```

## Model Performance

The U-Net with ResNet encoder provides:
- Effective feature extraction through ResNet backbone
- Spatial detail preservation via skip connections
- Stable training and convergence
- Good colorization quality for SAR imagery
